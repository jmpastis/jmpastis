We use Statcast data from the 2015–2024 MLB seasons to evaluate batters' decision-making. For every traded player since 2015, we collect pitch-by-pitch metrics and weight outcomes using league-average expected run values. Using player and pitcher metrics, we train an XGBoost model to predict probabilities and expected runs for swinging and not swinging. We then create the Obvious Score, a categorical metric with four values: correct and obvious, incorrect and obvious, correct and not obvious, and incorrect and not obvious. A multinomial logistic model assigns scores to each category—favoring, for example, correct but not obvious decisions with large positive values.
